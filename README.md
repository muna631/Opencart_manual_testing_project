Test Strategy 
As part of Functional Testing, we will follow the below approach for Testing: 
Step#1 – Creation of Test Scenarios and Test Cases for the different features in 
scope.  
• We will apply several Test Designing techniques while creating Test Cases  
o Equivalence Class Partition 
o Boundary Value Analysis 
o Decision Table Testing 
o State Transition Testing 
o Use Case Testing 
• We also use our expertise in creating Test Cases by applying the below: 
o Error Guessing 
o Exploratory Testing 
• We prioritise the Test Cases 
Step#2 – Our Testing process, when we get an Application for Testing: 
• Firstly, we will perform Smoke Testing to check whether the different and 
important functionalities of the application are working. 
• We reject the build, if the Smoke Testing fails and will wait for the stable 
build before performing in depth testing of the application functionalities. 
• Once we receive a stable build, which passes Smoke Testing, we perform 
in depth testing using the Test Cases created. 
• Multiple Test Resources will be testing the same Application on Multiple 
Supported Environments simultaneously. 
• We then report the bugs in bug tracking tool and send dev. management 
the defect found on that day in a status end of the day email. 
• As part of the Testing, we will perform the below types of Testing: 
o Smoke Testing and Sanity Testing 
o Regression Testing and Retesting  
o Usability Testing, Functionality & UI Testing  
• We repeat Test Cycles until we get the quality product. 
Step#3 – We will follow the below best practices to make our Testing better: 
• Context Driven Testing – We will be performing Testing as per the context 
of the given application. 
• Shift Left Testing – We will start testing from the beginning stages of the 
development itself, instead of waiting for the stable build. 
• Exploratory Testing – Using our expertise we will perform Exploratory

Defect Reporting Procedure: 
During the test execution –  
• Any deviation from expected behaviour by the application will be noted. If 
it can’t be reported as a defect, it’d be reported as an observation/issue or 
posed as a question. 
• Any usability issues will also be reported. 
• After discovery of a defect, it will be retested to verify reproducibility of 
the defect. Screenshots with steps to reproduce are documented. 
• Every day, at the end of the test execution, defects encountered will be 
sent along with the observations. 
Note: 
• Defects will be documented in a excel. 
• Test scenarios and Test cases will be documented in an excel document.

Test Planning 
Entry Criteria: 
• Testable Requirements derived from the given Requirements Documents 
or Project details 
• Doubts are cleared 
Exit Criteria: 
• Test Plan document (includes Test Strategy) is signed-off by the Client  
Test Designing 
Entry Criteria: 
• Test Plan Document is signed-off by the Client 
Exit Criteria: 
• Test Scenarios and Test Cases Documents are signed-off by the Client 
Test Execution 
Entry Criteria: 
• Test Scenarios and Test Cases Documents are signed-off by the Client 
• Application is ready for Testing 
Exit Criteria: 
• Test Case Reports, Defect Reports are ready 
Test Closure 
Entry Criteria: 
• Test Case Reports, Defect Reports are ready 
Exit Criteria: 
• Test Summary Reports 


Risks and Mitigations 
The following are the list of risks possible and the ways to mitigate them: 
Risk: Non-Availability of a Resource 
Mitigation: Backup Resource Planning 
Risk: Build URL is not working 
Mitigation: Resources will work on other tasks 
Risk: Less time for Testing 
Mitigation: Ramp up the resources based on the Client needs dynamically

Approvals 
Team will send different types of documents for Client Approval like below: 
• Test Plan 
• Test Scenarios 
• Test Cases 
• Reports 
Testing will only continue to the next steps once these approvals are done.
